# UI Project for L4 Apprenticeship, proof of concept. This project will be entirely using 
# dummy data, this is due to the fact that it is a proof of concept that a front end
# GUI/Web interface can be generated and created to allow an end user to access particular
# personell records and benefit rates, among other required user needs.


// The user needs are described below, for what the minimum viable product will be for the IICS 
// team.

User Need:
 
Telephone enquiry users in operational offices need to quickly access key customer and payment details to improve call efficiency. Research has identified that the most commonly asked questions include:
 
What is my weekly benefit rate and how is it made up?
When was my last payment due?
When is my next payment due?
What bank account is my payment being sent to?
Are all my dependents included in the assessment (for income related benefits only)?
Does my pension include anything based on my husbands contributions (State Pension claims only)?
When does my contributory benefit end (for JSA Contributary)?
Am I getting Higher or Lower Rate Mobility component (DLA â€“ may have a motability car).
 
Processing staff will identify the customer record and undertake basic security checking, ie asking key questions against information we hold, to verify it is the customer before being able to share any data.
 
For this exercise you are building a front end UI solution. To demonstrate the prototype solution you should create a simple DB that will contain dummy data that the screens will draw input from.

So as above is the general epic required of the project, im going to start off with breaking the user needs into smaller tickets, to then add to a kanban board of types, and then will add the user tickets to that board and progress as i go on. Please See the documentation folder for more details.
